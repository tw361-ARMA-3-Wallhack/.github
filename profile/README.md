## üîç What Is the ARMA 3 Wallhack?

The **wallhack**, also known as ESP (Extrasensory Perception), gives you visual overlays in-game that reveal **everything hidden** behind walls, hills, buildings, or foliage. It works for both **AI and real players**, and it‚Äôs designed to work undetected alongside BattlEye when injected properly.

Forget guessing. Now you **know** where every threat or target is.
